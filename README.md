# Python Auction System

## Overview
This Python application provides a simple auction system where users can buy and sell items through bidding. It facilitates auctions by allowing users to create listings for items, place bids on listings, and monitor ongoing auctions.

## Features
- User authentication: Users can register an account and log in securely to participate in auctions.
- Listing creation: Sellers can create listings for items they want to auction.
- Bidding system: Users can place bids on active listings.
- Automatic bidding: Bidders can set maximum bid amounts, and the system will automatically place bids on their behalf up to that amount.
- Real-time updates: Users receive notifications about new bids and auction status updates.
